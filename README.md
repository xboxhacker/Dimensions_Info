# Dimensions_Info
Sketchup plugin to get model X Y Z dimensions

This plugin is based on the work of JimF! 

His plugin worked fine, but I wanted to tweak it a little bit for my need. He used an "Alert Box". There for the text of the model dimensions were not copyable.

So I modified the plugin for use a HTML Box to display the dimensions. I also color coordinated the axis measurements for there respective colors (R,G,B)
